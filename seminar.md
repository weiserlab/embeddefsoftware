# Student Seminar

Student-led seminars are a critical component of the course, with attendance and active participation serving as key metrics for course  evaluation. They require students to present a recent research paper (published within the last ten years) from prominent conferences in the field of embedded systems, such as ACM MobiSys, SenSys, MobiCom, Sigcomm, IMWUT, and NSDI.
